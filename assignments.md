# Assignments

This page lists the programming assignments for the course.

Some advice about the programming assignments:

* Do not wait until the last minute to start: if we give you two weeks to complete an assignment, it's because we expect that it will take you two weeks (working steadily)
* Ask questions on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com) and in office hours
* Use good programming practices
* Test your code thoroughly (plan to spend about as much time testing the code as writing it)

*Individual* assignments must be completed individually.

For *Pair* assignments, you may work with one partner, or do the assignment individually.

Please read the [style guidelines](assign/style.html) so that you know what our coding style expectations are.
