## Course Expectations &amp; Grading

Class meetings will consist of lecture and discussion, interspersed with
in-class activities.

Your course grade will be determined as follows:

* Programming assignments: 55%
* Exams: 40% (3 exams, each worth 13.<span style="text-decoration: overline;">3</span>%)
* Participation: 5%

You have a total of 120 late hours to use as needed for homework
assignments throughout the course. Each 60 minute period following an
assignment deadline is considered to be one late hour: for example, if
an assignment is due at 11pm on Friday, but you submit your assignment
at 11:30pm on Friday, you have used one late hour. If you are planning
on using more than 48 late hours on an assignment, please send a
private message to the instructors on Piazza to let us know. Assignment
submissions which exceed the maximum number of late hours will (generally)
not be considered for credit.  Having said that, we understand that
exceptional circumstances can arise.  If you are in a situation where you
think you may need additional late hours, please notify your instructor.

You are expected to participate in in-person/synchronous class meetings.

Additional activities counting towards participation credit include the following:

* Attending office hours (in person or remotely)
* Asking and/or answering questions on Piazza
* Watching lecture recording videos

## Ethics

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by
the *Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy*:

> Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic
> integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The
> university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment,
> failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or
> expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law or other professional
> or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
> 
> Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments
> without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices,
> unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery
> and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair
> competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.
> 
> Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except
> where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and
> programming assignments without the help of others. For example, you must
> not look at anyone else’s solutions (including program code) to your
> homework problems. However, you may discuss assignment specifications
> (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required
> by the assignment.
> 
> If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside
> sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly
> cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your
> group projects must list everyone who participated.
> 
> Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
> 
> Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular
> assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not
> sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs,
> as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from other students. (3)
> Cite any questionable sources of help you may have received.
> 
> On every exam, you will sign the following pledge: "I agree to complete
> this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person, materials or
> device. [Signed and dated]". Your course instructors will let you know
> where to find copies of old exams, if they are available.

Report any violations you witness to the instructor.

## Classroom Climate

As your instructor, I am committed to creating a classroom environment that values the diversity of experiences and perspectives that all students bring. Everyone here has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. I believe fostering an inclusive climate is important because research and my experience show that students who interact with peers who are different from themselves learn new things and experience tangible educational outcomes. Please join me in creating a welcoming and vibrant classroom climate. Note that you should expect to be challenged intellectually by me, the TAs, and your peers, and at times this may feel uncomfortable. Indeed, it can be helpful to be pushed sometimes in order to learn and grow. But at no time in this learning process should someone be singled out or treated unequally on the basis of any seen or unseen part of their identity.

If you ever have concerns in this course about
harassment, discrimination, or any unequal treatment, or if you seek
accommodations or resources, I invite you to share directly with me or
the TAs. I promise that we will take your communication seriously and
to seek mutually acceptable resolutions and accommodations. Reporting
will never impact your course grade. You may also share concerns
with the department/center chair/head/director (Randal Burns, [randal@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:randal@cs.jhu.edu)),
the Director of Undergraduate Studies (Joanne Selinski, [joanne@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:joanne@cs.jhu.edu)),
the Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion (Darlene Saporu, [dsaporu@jhu.edu](mailto:dsaporu@jhu.edu)),
or the Office of Institutional Equity ([oie@jhu.edu](mailto:oie@jhu.edu)).
In handling reports, people will protect your privacy
as much as possible, but faculty and staff are required to
officially report information for some cases (e.g. sexual harassment).

## Family Accommodations Policy

You are welcome to bring a family member to class on occasional days
when your responsibilities require it (for example, if emergency child
care is unavailable, or for health needs of a relative).  In fact,
you may see my children in class on days when their school is closed. 
Please be sensitive to the classroom environment, and if your family
member becomes uncomfortably disruptive, you may leave the classroom
and return as needed.

## University Policy on Incompletes

The university recognizes that the Spring 2021 semester is surrounded
with uncertainty and many students may find themselves in unexpected
situations where study is difficult if not impossible. Students who are
confronted with extraordinary circumstances that interfere with their
ability perform their academic work may request an incomplete grade
from the instructor. While approval of such a request is not automatic,
it is expected that faculty will make every effort to accommodate
students dealing with illness in the family and other pandemic-related
hardships. The instructor and student must establish a timetable for
submitting the unfinished work with a final deadline no later than the
end of the third week of the Fall 2021 semester.  Exceptions to this
deadline require a petition from the instructor to the student’s
academic advising office before that date. When entering an Incomplete
grade in SIS, faculty must include a reversion grade which represents
the grade the student will receive if s/he does not complete the missing
work by the agreed-upon deadline.

## Deadlines for Adding, Dropping and Withdrawing from Courses

Students may add a course up to **February 5, 2021**. They may drop courses
up to **March 7, 2020** provided they remain registered for a minimum of 12
credits. Between **March 8 and April 16, 2021**, a student may withdraw
from a course with a W on their academic record. A record of the course
will remain on the academic record with a W appearing in the grade column
to indicate that the student registered and then withdrew from the course.
